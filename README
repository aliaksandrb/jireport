jireport is console app in ruby 1.9

It is designed to create custom reports of issue resolve activity in JIRA.

bin/fetch - Fetches issues state and tracks it to database,
            allowing to add additional data based on comparison
            with already stored one.
            Database is accessed via ActiveRecord (from Rails 3.0).

bin/report - Generates report based on stored data,
             for now, using Google Spreadsheet API.

Most configuration you need is in config/ direcrory.
